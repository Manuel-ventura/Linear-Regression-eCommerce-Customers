# Linear Regression eCommerce Customers

## Introduction

This project applies linear regression to model the relationship between a dependent variable (e.g., customer spending) and one or more independent variables (e.g., customer demographics and behavior). The goal is to establish a linear equation that best predicts customer spending based on these variables.

## Objectives

- **Data Extraction:** Gather relevant data for modeling.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create features that enhance model performance.
- **Model Training:** Train a linear regression model to predict customer spending.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Insights:** Generate insights based on model results to inform business decisions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manuel-ventura/Linear-Regression-eCommerce-Customers.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Linear-Regression-eCommerce-Customers
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Linear Regression .ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the linear regression analysis.

## Results

The linear regression model provides insights into which factors are most predictive of customer spending. This information can be used to tailor marketing strategies and optimize customer interactions to increase sales.
